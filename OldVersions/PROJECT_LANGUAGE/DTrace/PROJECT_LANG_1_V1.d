* I decided to make DTrace the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-DTrace) as DTrace is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the DTrace programming language. It only makes sense to DTrace the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
